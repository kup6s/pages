# ClusterRole Rationale:
# The operator watches StaticSites across all namespaces (multi-tenant design).
# Resources (IngressRoutes, Middlewares, Certificates, Services) are created
# in the StaticSite's namespace, not a fixed system namespace.
# This is the standard pattern for namespace-scoped operators.
# See docs/SECURITY.md for detailed RBAC documentation.
rules:
  # StaticSite CRD - watch and manage existing resources
  # The operator does NOT create or delete StaticSites (users do that).
  # update/patch needed for adding finalizers.
